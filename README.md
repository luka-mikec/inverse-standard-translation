This tool produces a locally equivalent modal formula for a given first-order formula (the inverse of the standard translation).

Note that it can process only very short formulas, due to the fact that given a formula of quantifier complexity *n*, this tool will essentially try to solve a first-order tree for a certain formula of complexity ~2n. 

The underlying algorithm is due to Tin Perkov. This work has been supported by Croatian Science Foundation (HRZZ) under the projects UIP-05-2017-9219 (see [FORMALS](http://formals.ufzg.hr/) for more information) and IP-01-2018-7459.
